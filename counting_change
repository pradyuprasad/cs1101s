    /* 
    logic of this program is you split the program into 2 parts
    one is try and make it with the largest coin.and the 2nd part is 
    to try to make it WITHOUT the largest coin. these are mutually 
    exclusive (largest coin is only in the first but not the second)
    and collectiveky exhaustive ( there are by definition only 2 ways - one with
    and the other without)
    
    in part 1 you try and make it with the largest coin.
    
    how do you make it with the largest one? you subtract the amount from the
    largest coin to see what's left. (call this a - d). and then make (a - d) 
    with the same number of coins.
    
    basically you get cc(a-d, coins)
    
    then part 2: make the total number of coins WITHOUT the largest coin
    just return cc(a, coins - 1)
